# 1. GNCK PERN To Do App
    This is the Milestone two project of all stars Casey, Kristen, Nick and Gregg for the NCSU Software Development Bootcamp.  The goal ofthis project was to demonstrate our knowledge and understanding of a fuulstack application from conception to deployment.  It is a culmination of all of our work in the software development course with a specific focus on building from scratch a React front end, an Express back end, connecting to a PostgreSQL database, and running in a Node environment. Our overarching goal was to build an API that relied on RESTful pricipals, keeping our code as DRY as possible, and to make an app that was functional and useful, and that looked good too. This project differed from our last in that it involved a group that allowed us begin to better understand what a real working environment in this field could be like.  We at once had to put aside any apprehension and learn very quickly to cooperate and help each other navigate the ins and outs of collaborative coding.  

## 2. Outline 
    In order to organize our original thoughts, we started our planning with an outline.  It was not 100% complete, and it had some things that would change in the end, but it helped us to get going.

    Here is what our outline looked like:

### Pern to do List outline

1. Build server
2. Create folder to hold client and server
3. In server NPM init
4. NPM install express, PG, cors
5. Touch index.js
6. In index.js require express
7. Cont app = express()
8. app.listen(5000, () => {console.log(“server has started on port 5000)});
9. Start nodemon
10. Const cors = require(“cors”);
11. Create middleware (app.use(cors())
12. app.use(express.json());
13. Create postgres database and table

24. Create a file called db.js
25. Inside db.js   const Pool = require(“pg”),Pool;
26. Below that const pool = new Poolmodule.exports = pool;
27. Go back to index.js    const pool = require(“./db”);

34. Get rid of service worker
35. Get rid of logo
36. Go into index.js
37. Get rid of service worker stuff and comments

54. Const InputTodo = () => {
				-Return (
				-<h1> Input todo</h1>
				-)
			    - }
55. Export default InputTodo;
56. Go to app.js 
57. Import InputTodo from “./components/InputTodo”
58. Inside fragment in function app put <InputTodo>
59. Add <div className=”container”>
60. Go back into InputTodo component folder 
61. Add {Fragment} to React import statement
62. Put <Fragment> in InputTodo function
63. Add <h1>To do List</h1 > inside fragment in  function
64. Add className of “text-center and mt5

68. Add React hooks { Fragment, useStste }
69. In the top of the function before return add const[description, setDescription] = useState (“”)
70. After input type=text className=formControl add value={description}
71. After that onChange={e => setDescription(e.taget.value)}
72. After the UseState of # 70  const onSubmitForm =async(e) => {
					-e.preventDefault();
    -Try{
    -const body = { description };
    -Const response = await  fetch(“http://localhost:5000/todos”, {
    -method: “POST”,
    -headers: {“Content-Type”: “application/json” },
    -body:  JSON.stringify(body)
    -});
    -} catch (err) {
    -console.error(err.message)
    -}
73.    Add onSubmit={onSubmitform} to form at d-flex
74. Build the ListTodo
75. Import React
76. Const ListTodos function
77. Export default
78. Go into index.js and import ListTodos from components
79. Add it to the index function
80. Add fragment to ListTodo
81. Get table tag from bootstrap and add it to ListTodos function
82. Add table class “table mt-5 text-center”
83. Make the displays for the table description, edit, delete

88. Inside todos map add <tr> key={todo.todo_id}</tr> to get todo id
89. In delete  button add onClick ={() => deleteTodo(todo.todo_id)}
90. Back at the top of ListTodos create delete function
91. Build the edit todo component
92. Inside EditTodo import React from React
93. Make edit function
94. Get  modal button from bootstrap
95. Build button just like the the delete
